reactive.coffee
===============

Functional Reactive Programming library for CoffeeScript. Completely undocumented at the moment, and pretty much everything is subject to change.

Inspired by:

- [Reactive Dart](https://github.com/prujohn/Reactive-Dart)
- [Deprecating the Observer Pattern](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~imaier/pub/DeprecatingObserversTR2010.pdf)
- [FlapJax](http://www.flapjax-lang.org/)
- [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)

Used to make:

- [Candor.fm](http://candor.fm/)

No new ideas here really, just an object-oriented lib that's nice and easy to use in CoffeeScript.
